# CW-Role v0.1.0

## What is this?

This is an Ansible role for the installation of Nextcloud with all requirements.
After the run, you should point your web browser to the IP of the client machine
where Ansible was run against it; there you should see the Nextcloud installation/initialization process.
It is the successor and official release of [PROJECT-323](https://github.com/lxwulf/PROJECT-323).

## Status

This is a very early version of the role. So the most updates would be to improve the
tasks and the role itself. Additional packages like `redis` or `fail2ban` may follow, but,
not at the moment.

Later on, this document and also the general documentation of this repository will be updated too.

Optional more infos can be found in the [docs](docs/background_story_of_project-323.md) folder.
