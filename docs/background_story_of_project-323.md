# Background of PROJECT-323 aka CW-Role_v0.1.0

## How did it begin?

It is a personal project with aiming to being useful, not just for myself.
With this project, I learned Ansible from the beginning. At first with
easy task like installing a package until complex tasks like setup SELinux rules.
At the time I thought what process could I automate, then I remembered I had a difficult
time with the installation of the Nextcloud suite. So the idea was born to automate
that process.

## Errors, what else?

I came across more problems to solve as I thought. Because many things were different from the
beginning. I set up a cloud server before, but this was a Debian system. By the way, this was also the main reason
why I decided to set up the whole server new. With fedora server, I have mostly the newest package available
and also can upgrade the system to the next release easily.

Anyway, at the start of the project run from one wall to next one until I realized I had very different system
build to Debian. So I needed to learn more about Fedora. The config file where in different places also sometimes
split up. SELinux came also to the game. And yes the permission issues with the different servers and SELinux
together was a fun game.

At that point, I sometimes thought I need to give upâ€¦ But that was just a weak moment. With help from others in the
Linux's community from different places on earth but also on different online platforms, I got it to work!

## What brings the future?

Actually, I don't know but, I would try to update and improve the tasks as good as I can.
